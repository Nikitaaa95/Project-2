# Recipe generator 

## Description 

The motivation behind this project was to create a recipe website application where after signing in, users can post recipe data with content about specific recipe details that they can retrieve and view, which was created using both the front end and back end. We built this application because it creates a website for users to efficiently utilize recipe information so that that they can easily create and view that recipe information (prep time, cook time, ingredients, etc) in one place.

## Installation 
First connect to the recipe_db by running "mysql -u root -p", source db/schema.sql and then create the database. 
Use "npm init -y" to retrieve the package.json file, and "npm i" to install the necesary modules. 
Use "npm run seed" to seed your data and then "npm run start" to start the application
